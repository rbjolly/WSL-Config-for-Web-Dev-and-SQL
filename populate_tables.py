# Note: The following information may not apply to Ubuntu 24.04 as it was 
# initially done uner 20.04.

# When DBeaver generated this file, it requires that python have the 
# followingh modules installed in order to query Postgres:
#   psycopg2==2.8.5
#   python-decouple==3.3

# But to run under Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL, which has a version of 
# Python (3.7+ as of 2023-05-18) which is not compatible with the 
# above listed modules, you'll need to install an alternative. I chose pg8000.
# So, this example file, which is based on a backup file created using DBeaver
# shows the pg8000 code required to connect and query a local Postgres server.
# For more info, see the pg8000 github page.
